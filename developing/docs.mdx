## Clone the docs repository

The easiest method of modifying the documentation is to have a local copy of the repo, which you can get by running the below command, or whatever your personal preference is for getting the repository on your computer.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:theopenlane/docs.git
```

## Setup Mintlify

<Info>
  **Prerequisite** You should have installed Node.js (version 18.10.0 or
  higher). Check out nvm if you need a version manager for node
</Info>

Step 1. Install Mintlify on your OS:

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm i -g mintlify
```

```bash yarn
yarn global add mintlify
```

</CodeGroup>

Step 2. Go to where the docs are located (where you can find `mint.json`) and run the following command:

```bash
mintlify dev
```

The documentation website is now available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Code Formatting

We suggest using appropriate extensions on your IDE to recognize and format MDX. If youâ€™re a VSCode user, consider using the MDX VSCode extension for syntax highlighting, and Prettier for code formatting.
