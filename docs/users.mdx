## Resource Ownership

Organizations are the holders / owners of resources created within the tenancy model, but a confirmed user in active state must be associated with the Organization ownership role. A user will always be the owner of their Personal Organization, they will very commonly be members of Organizations other than their Personal, and they will likely be the owner of other Organizations or Child Organizations depending on desired system configuration(s).

## Resource Assignment

## Membership

Users will hold "memberships" to objects such as Groups, Organizations, Projects, etc. They will also hold ownership of resources which is the assignment of a role-level within openlane's authorization constructs, as the "parent" of resources within openlane are always the tenant(s) of the associated tree.

## Entitlements


## Personal Organizations

After being created, a user can be granted access to a tenant, which allows them to perform operations and access resources within that tenant and all its sub-tenants. Users can be granted access to one or more tenants, as needed, and can be managed through the user and permissions APIs exposed / provided by openlane.
