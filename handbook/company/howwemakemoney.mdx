# By giving first
As developers ourselves, we started our careers by using products that were either open source or had a free tier.

We believe it's important to let people try the product before they make a purchase decision, and that's why we have a generous free tier.

This is not only a way to capture new leads with a low customer acquisition cost, but also a way for us to give back.

Of course, we still need to pay our bills, so once a user likes our product and gains value from it, we should not be afraid to charge for it.

# By providing value
Openlane is a multi-product company, and we believe in providing individual subscriptions that reflect what people are getting value out of it, instead of a one-size-fits-all pricing strategy.

Some users only need transactional emails, others only need marketing emails, and there are many that need both.

Our pricing reflects that reality, and we structure it so that customers can add new subscriptions or cancel anytime in case you no longer have a need for it.

# By growing together
If a solo developer is using openlane for their side project, they shouldn't be charged a ton of money for it.

If a company is growing and dealing with very complex use cases, they should be charged in a scalable way based on their usage.

We believe in having progressive pricing tiers in which the cost per unit gets cheaper as the volume grows.

That way, solo developers and scaling companies can benefit the same way.
