# Radically intentional
Without constant and intentional communication, we cannot stay aligned with our goals. This is especially true for a remote company.

If we have questions, we should ask them. If something isn't clear, we should ask for clarification. If something doesn't seem to be headed toward our goals or values, we should challenge it.

Ideally, this is done async on Slack, so the whole team can stay in the loop and collaborate, but there are times that we need to talk it out face to face. A Slack Huddle or Google Meet is a great solution (make sure to ask before calling).

It is better to break async and take a moment to synchronize than continue with misalignment.

# In the open
When companies grow, there's a natural tendency for people to start having conversations in DMs instead of group channels. This typically happens because they don't want to bother others or be too noisy. The problem is that it leads to silos and missed opportunities for collaboration.

We have to try extra hard to capture the benefits traditionally taken for granted in a physical office like spontaneous knowledge sharing over lunch or coffee breaks.

By having conversations in the open, we can make information searchable and future posts can be linked to old posts. We create space for serendipitous discussions and teamwork. This is especially important when thinking about folks who just joined the team.

There are obviously exceptions - when talking about compensation, performance, or other sensitive HR matters it's important to do this in private, but other than that we should default to talking in the open.

# Active listening
Conversations are typically bi-directional, but that doesn't mean you should speak all the time just for the sake of speaking.

One misconception many people have is that we need to listen to reply, whereas in reality, we need to listen to understand. Understanding someone is far more important than replying to someone. Anyone can reply, few can understand.

Regardless of the conversation that we're having, we must practice the habit of active listening. Not just listening in order to reply, but truly trying to understand what point the other person is trying to convey.

# Surgically clear
As humans, we all have a need to be liked. Sometimes we put the need to be liked in front of our honest opinions in order to please others.

We care about creating a safe space where anyone can speak up and share their personal opinions about a product, a feature, or an executive decision.

We prefer to be intellectually honest instead of sugarcoating the truth to avoid potential conflict.

Note: this doesn't mean you can be rude to others.

# Be kind
Helping others is part of the job.

It's okay to admit you don't know something and ask for help - it's a sign of strength, not weakness.

Remember the words of one of the greatest comedians of all time:

"Everyone you meet is fighting a battle you know nothing about.

Be kind. Always."

â€• Robin Williams

We always assume positive intent and we're kind to each other.
