When we sat down together to start Openlane, we knew we wanted to help the people working at the core of modern businesses. Typically workking in "cost centers", these humans put in the long hours to get the job done no matter what. They typically receive limited investment from their business, and carry a disproportionate load of responsibility. 

If you think about it, you either are that person, or you can name them (Tom, Justin, Shelby, Tony). They are the centers of gravity, the people who can answer any question or be thrown on any customer call without preparation to solve problems with mastery. 

These people aren't afraid to try new tools that help solve their problems, but they have *high standards* for their tools -and that's what we're inspired by: we want to make tools that this incredible community of humans wants to use. We want to replace cumbersome processes that consume time and energy so these people can get back to the infrastructure and projects that inspire them!
