    Makers don't wait. When we see a problem, we don't expect someone else to fix it or tell us what to do. We take initiative, find creative ways around the problem, and send a pull request to solve it.

    We dig deep into complex issues and are always learning new skills. We don't cosplay as builders; we actively practice and learn through our mistakes and successes.
