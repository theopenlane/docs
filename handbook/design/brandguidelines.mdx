## Tone and grammar

At Openlane, we write the way we speak. Our friendly and conversational tone is as natural as it is intentional -after all, our missions is to support leaders and operators. We don't need to "scare" people with formal, intimidating language. They know what they're doing is incredibly important. We help the way we'd like to be helped, with enough knowledge to sell to an enterprise, but in a tone people want to work with. 

We use active, present tense when possible and specifically avoid the future imperfect. For example: 
* We will execute a maintenance on Sunday
as opposed to:
* A maintenance will be executed on Sunday
or:
* We will be executing a maintenance on Sunday

For use of Openlane: 
* the l in lane is always lowercase
* Openlane is always one word
* the company is always capital
* first word in a sentance is always capital
* the product is lower case
