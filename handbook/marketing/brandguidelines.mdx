## Imagery
Icons, image design elements, and photo types that are to be used.

## Logo design and use
Guidelines on logo usage, including color palette, file format(s), minimum and maximum sizes, contexts, spacing, and usage permissions, such as where images should and shouldnâ€™t appear.

## Fonts
Font styles and text sizes for both print and digital media.

## Iconography 
To ensure consistency and ease of use, we use phosphoicons (https://phosphoricons.com/).

An icon should communicate the meaning of the subject it relates to. There will be times when it is not fully possible to find an icon that literally describes your subject. In such cases, consider using a more symbolic icon.
