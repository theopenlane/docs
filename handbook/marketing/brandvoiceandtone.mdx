Our tone-of-voice guides how our communication represents our brand personality and helps us fulfill our mission. This document serves as a quick guide on how to sound distinctly like Openlane. 

## How Our Brand Feels
As people engage with Openlane, we want them to experience our brand as: innovative, trustworthy, and accessible (friendly and self-service oriented). We create bridges between teams like finance, accounting, operations, and engineering.

To support this experience, we: 
* Provide easy-to-navigate content that's oriented to both technology and business consumers
* Provide a product that's both developer and non-developer friendly
* Offer customization -no one needs to call us or our service team. Customers can just "use what they want"

## Tone and grammar
We write the way we speak. Our friendly and conversational tone is as natural as it is intentional -after all, our missions is to support leaders and operators. We don't need to "scare" people with formal, intimidating language. They know what they're doing is incredibly important. We help the way we'd like to be helped, with enough knowledge to sell to an enterprise, but in a tone people want to work with. 

We use active, present tense when possible and specifically avoid the future imperfect. For example: 
* We will execute a maintenance on Sunday
as opposed to:
* A maintenance will be executed on Sunday
or:
* We will be executing a maintenance on Sunday

For use of Openlane: 
* the l in lane is always lowercase
* Openlane is always one word
* the company is always capital
* first word in a sentance is always capital
* the product is lower case

US vs. UK English
* We write in US English. It gives us greater reach and increased familiarity amongst global audiences.

Use of capitalization
* We minimize the use of capital letters unless it is grammatically appropriate to use them.
* Reserve capitalization for abbreviations, the first word of every sentence, the names of people, products, titles, or businesses.
* Never use all caps for emphasis. When writing headings and titles, capitalize only the first word of the sentence and the first word after a full-stop.
