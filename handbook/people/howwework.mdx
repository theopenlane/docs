# Team Working Agreement

## Meetings

1. If you think you have to have a meeting, have a goal, agenda, and outcome (and send it in advance) or don't have a meeting; type your question in slack instead
1. Drive decisions through protyping, data, and documentation - asynchronously as possible. Conjecture about the universe isn't productive
1. Keep the audience in a meeting as limited as possible; instead of inviting a team, invite a representative. If 1 person can attend instead of 2, you saved an hour
1. Walk into sprint planning / retro with formulated thoughts, opinions, and an idea about what our highest priorities should be and speak up about those. "Leadership" is a two way street and that involves ensuring your voice is heard if you think we're working on the wrong things

## Code Related

1. Assume you’re wrong and try to be less wrong
1. Respond to PR comments with new code pushes. Don't bicker in git
    1. Ex: if you want to be pedantic about a method, make it yourself - don’t ask the PR author to do it for you
1. If it’s a high blast radius change, get as many eyes on the review as you can but lean into your safety to ship it and fail back if needed
1. Create PR templates so people have a guide on how to work with the code; if you have to explain it to someone verbally you're doing it wrong
1. Merge as quickly as reasonable, don’t let code linger - that might mean a later refactor, but stagant PR's are worse
1. Try to pair program where possible, pull a conversation into a zoom if comments become too difficult to get through but recap it in Slack for the rest of the team
1. Write good commit messages or at least funny ones
1. We have clear, concise documentation with intent of the various systems / dependencies; intent expresses purpose, which prevents misuse. Don't underestimate the power of articulating the intent under which something is done

## Team Communications

1. Call out bad behavior when you see it to the group. If you feel uncomfortable doing that, call the behavior out privately. Not calling it out at all is the worst outcome for everyone
1. Don’t page / escalate to other humans for non-customer facing issues
1. Keep slack rooms and dialogs public, and if rooms get too noisy then you can create another more purpose-specific room, but don't have conversations in DM's that should otherwise be visible, even if it's uncomfortable (you'll see Matt do this plenty - yes it might be "cringy" but also then everyone knows exactly what was said and the context it was said in, vs. "having a meeting" and then some edict for change that provides no intent or context == bad)
1. We run post-mortems for incidents, or other events worthy of our reflection and consideration for how to be a better team, and build better systems

## Technology

1. Pick the best tool for the job
1. Don't give into pressure from external sources (or anyone) to use something; just because they know it, or someone knows someone that works there, or because some other team already chose it
1. Have a strong opinion, whether your opinion gets adopted or used or not doesn't change the value of having it and articulating it
1. Don't be butt hurt about technology choices if we do, for whatever reason, have to pick something that's less than ideal


## Untangible

1. Be honest
1. Be hungry
1. Be aware, and self-aware
1. Put tips in the jar for Don Gato
