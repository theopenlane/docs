Our knowledge base is a collection of answers to frequently asked questions, and solutions to commonly occurring issues. The goal for our knowledge base is to keep Resend as self-service as possible, so customers can get answers without reaching out to the Support team.

# Documentation vs. knowledge base
Documentation is your dictionary; the knowledge base is your cheat sheet.

Simply put, the documentation tells you how to use the product. It's structured, comprehensive, and covers everything from set up, to advanced configurations. These include topics like creating a domain, creating an audience, or deleting a contact.

The knowledge base on the other hand is a lot more diverse, and contains articles and guides about frequently asked questions, recommendations on topics like deliverability, or if you should add an unsubscribe link to your emails.

# Self-service
Skip the queue, solve it solo.

The goal for our knowledge base is to help customers get answers to questions without needing to reach out to support.

This means that the knowledge base should be easy to search for, and the articles should be easy to understand.

# Up-to-date
Old answers lead to new problems.

It's crucial for knowledge base articles to be up-to-date, especially if the goal is to solve issues as fast as possible. Having outdated information increases the time-to-resolution for our customers, and decreases our efficiency as a team.

We use our support tickets as a guide to creating knowledge base articles. In a perfect world, we wouldn't have any of these, and they would all be solved in the product. However, having a knowledge base is a great way to bridge the gap while our team works on making the product answer the questions for you.
